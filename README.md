# AnalysisOfAlgorithms-SortingAlgorithms
## In this repository you can find the following Algorithms:

### MergeAndInsertionSorts
- This project includes Merge and Insertion Sort Algorithms written in C++ language.
- Aim of the project is inclued in the pdf file.
- Detailed explanation of the code and Algorithms are in the report pdf file.
- You can run this code by using:
  - g++ insertion.h merge.h main.cpp -o yourExecutable
  - ./yourExecutable -algo algorithmType -feature criteration -size N
  - algorithmType => m or i 
    - m represents Merge Sort
    - i represents Insertion Sort
  - criteration => p or t
    - p represents price
    - t represents time
  - N => size 
    - for example 1000000
  
### HeapSort
- This project includes working with heaps and Heap Functions written in C++ language.
- Aim of the project is included in the pdf file.
- Detailed explanation is in the report pdf file.
- You can see the csv dataset files. 
- You can run this code by using:
  - g++ HeapSort.h HeapSort.cpp Node.h main.cpp -o yourExecutable
  - ./yourExecutable

### HashTable
- This project includes working with hash dictionary and Open Adressing Methods.
  - Linear Probing
  - Double Hashing
  - Universal Hashing
- Aim of the project is included in the pdf file.
- Detailed explanation is in the report pdf file.
- g++ Hash.h Hash.cpp main.cpp -o yourExecutable
- ./yourExecutable vocab.txt search.txt
